         		<p class="paragraph_first">Kherson, 24 y.o., orphan</p>
         		<p class="paragraph_second">I, Butenko Oleksandra (Sasha) Yuriivna, was born in 1993 and now I am 24. When I was young my parents left me. Until I was 6, I had lived in baby house, then I was sent into orphanage, where I spent 10 years. Then I entered Herson National Navy Academy, where I got degree of junior specialist in electromechanics. While I was studying, I met Nadiya who helped me find God. In 2013 I moved into girls center. I lived with three other girls and our mentor, Nadiya, who prepared us to independent life, cooked food with us, taught about God and cared about us. On january 2nd 2013 I let Jesus into my heart and on Jan 8th I was baptized. I had bad times, but every day God made me happy. In 2014 my mentor Nadiya went to Kyrgystan. She was serving as a missionary there for students, children, adults and homeless people. As I had two month of free time I decided to visit her in order to help her. It was there that I understood than we all are different, there are a lot of abandoned people, but there are also people, who care for them, even when they are completely strangers. There are people, called missioners, or just people, willing to give others what they have, and what I missed in childhood: support, ability to lean on and faith in God, father to all of us. I have no parents, who can raise me, feed or teach me. I have God, my father, instead, who loves me, supports me, protects me and always is close to me. God gave me the opportunity to work in Christian cafe. I served in the church and sang in church chorus too. God blessed me with many talents: drawing and decorating, those are my hobbies and my free time activities. I want to realize myself in that sphere. This year I finished studying and had no clue where to move next...
            1​​Corinthians​​1:30​​It is because of him that you are in Christ Jesus, who has become for us wisdom from God—that is, our righteousness, holiness and redemption.I was praying, leaving this decision to God. I was sure that I will get answer from Him. My Christian friends recommend me moving to Lviv. Question where to live, study and work quickly arose. All my friends would not answer me. I was starting to feel worried. Then Sergiy Nakonechnyy decided to help me. He introduced me to Ihor, who offered a place to live and study for me. That was the answer to my prayers.My dream is to become a web designer. I hope to get new knowledge, become professional, get work and serve God with my talents. I thank God for being kind to me and for his love!</p>
